## UI Updates for AudioPlayer Class

Major UI updates have been made to the AudioPlayer. I've decided to split up the UI into two main components; the wave form display and the audio controller. The wave form diaplay shall be reponsible for creating the wave form of the audio file while the audio controller controls the audio settings of the fie, such as pause/play, skip, rewind, and load new file.

## Next Milestone Goals

* Add UI feature to the audio controller to add a song to queue
* Add functionality to save the audio file path, so that upon exit, the audio files can be booted up with the program and the user can view the audio files without needing to load them on startup every time.

## Future Plans

* Create navigation buttons for the main pages/features of the audio production tool.
* Draw wave form of the selected audio file.
* Add functionality for project creation and load project.
* Create functionality for making a sound track using sub-tracks.
