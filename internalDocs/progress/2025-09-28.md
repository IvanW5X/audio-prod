## Updates for audio player and general project management

The audio player has been further divided into now 3 main widgets, so that the audi oplayer serves as the high level component for managing the audio player page. The new class that has been added is the AudioData class which serves to present the readable data of the current audio file displaying the title, genre, artists, etc. Additionally, the UI classes have been renamed to add "Widget" at the end of each class to explicitly state that this class is a UI component rather than a backend supporting class.

Features for the AudioController are almost completed. The UI now updates with the audio file playing (e.g. audio slider, duration text, media buttons), the volume sliders, text, and mute button have been implemented with functionality, and the current file can now be displayed in human readable format with a list widget view.

A an issue was found with setting a new position of the media player where it would load the audio data into the list widget multiple time. This was due to the feature where QMediaPlayer would sometimes load the audio file again when new data is seen in a non contiguous manner. My original functionality had the AudioPlayer components update in the LoadedMedia signal, so to resolve this, the components now update on custom signals from AudioPlayer. The slot that calls the signals is called by the mediaStatusChanged signal, but an additional check is added to check the current file and if it is the same, do not emit the signals.

## Next Milestone Goals

* Draw the wave form of the current audio file for the AudioPlayer page.
* Add UI feature to the audio controller to add a song to queue.
* Add functionality to save the audio file path, so that upon exit, the audio files can be booted up with the program and the user can view the audio files without needing to load them on startup every time.

## Future Plans

* Create navigation buttons for the main pages/features of the audio production tool.
* Draw wave form of the selected audio file.
* Add functionality for project creation and load project.
* Create functionality for making a sound track using sub-tracks.
