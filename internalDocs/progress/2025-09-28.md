## Updates for audio player and general project management

The audio player has been further divided into now 3 main widgets, so that the audi oplayer serves as the high level component for managing the audio player page. The new class that has been added is the AudioData class which serves to present the readable data of the current audio file displaying the title, genre, artists, etc. Additionally, the UI classes have been renamed to add "Widget" at the end of each class to explicitly state that this class is a UI component rather than a backend supporting class.

## Next Milestone Goals

* Get and display the audio meta data onto the audio player components.
* Add UI feature to the audio controller to add a song to queue.
* Add functionality to save the audio file path, so that upon exit, the audio files can be booted up with the program and the user can view the audio files without needing to load them on startup every time.

## Future Plans

* Create navigation buttons for the main pages/features of the audio production tool.
* Draw wave form of the selected audio file.
* Add functionality for project creation and load project.
* Create functionality for making a sound track using sub-tracks.
