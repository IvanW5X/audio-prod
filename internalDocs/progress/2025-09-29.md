## Updates for General Project Managment

While thinking about the future implementations of the audio production tool, the issue I am coming across is about compromising DRY principles and expanding functionality into the mixing, and visualizing the audio data. I've discovered a new Qt class, QAudioSink, and have found that it's uses are better fit for my case for the project.

The current implmentation does have functionality for loading an audio file with error handling, updating UI components of the AudioPlayer, and playing/pausing the audio, but they classes are tightly coupled with each other. To resolve this issue, I will be refactoring the project to use an AudioEngine class that is responsible for handling low level audio functionality and can be used to process audio data without a UI. Additionally, the AudioEngine class can be set as a worker thread to prevent freezing the GUI thread and will use signals to emit the progress of whatever slot is called.

This new implementation of the AudioEngine would encapsulate the low level audio logic and processing into one class and provide all other UI class to just interface with possible another class that serves as the interface of the engine.

## Next Milestone Goals

* Redirect all low level audio processing for the AudioEngine class

## Backlog

* Draw the wave form of the current audio file for the AudioPlayer page.
* Add UI feature to the audio controller to add a song to queue.
* Add functionality to save the audio file path, so that upon exit, the audio files can be booted up with the program and the user can view the audio files without needing to load them on startup every time.

## Future Plans

* Create navigation buttons for the main pages/features of the audio production tool.
* Draw wave form of the selected audio file.
* Add functionality for project creation and load project.
* Create functionality for making a sound track using sub-tracks.
