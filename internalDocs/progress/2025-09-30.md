## Updates for Major Components

The refactoring process of the audio production tool has been begun. Implementation details have been updated to prevent as much DRY principles; the base components of the project will include the AudioController and AudioEngine classes. The AudioController will serve a high level interface for the AudioEngine class as well as a singleton for the whole project. The AudioController will be implement a separate worker thread and move the engine into this thread to prevent the GUI thread from freezing.

Progress updates for the AudioEngine include decoding audio files and sending out the chunks of decoded data into a thread safe buffer that is synced with the AudioController. This will give the illusion of low latency audio processing and further updates will be made to limit the size of the synced buffer to increase performance for memory management for larger files that have more chunks.

Progress for the AudioController include making it a singleton and thread management. The AudioEngine is moved to the dedicated engine thread upon the init() call to have more granial control over object instantiation. Thread clean up has also been added so that when the aboutToQuit signal is emited from the QApplication, the engine thread will quit and wait, cleaning up the thread and the singleton.

## Next Milestone Goals

* Redirect all low level audio processing for the AudioEngine class

## Backlog

* Draw the wave form of the current audio file for the AudioPlayer page.
* Add UI feature to the audio controller to add a song to queue.
* Add functionality to save the audio file path, so that upon exit, the audio files can be booted up with the program and the user can view the audio files without needing to load them on startup every time.

## Future Plans

* Create navigation buttons for the main pages/features of the audio production tool.
* Draw wave form of the selected audio file.
* Add functionality for project creation and load project.
* Create functionality for making a sound track using sub-tracks.
