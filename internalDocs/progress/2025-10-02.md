## Updates for Audio processing design and external libs

The TagLib library has been added as a package to the project to get meta data from audio files. This library is preferred over the built-in Qt projects because of it's high performance in reading and writing audio meta data. After reading the docs for QAudio related sections, the TagLib project can be used concurrently with the project give more flexibility and control over audio files for both the programmer (me) and the actua user.

More changes are coming with the design of the AudioController and AudioEngine interaction. The engine will still be in the worker thread for audio processing, but will now follow a request-response design pattern using a custom struct/data structure. The scalibility of constantlay adding new signals to send to the engine, then adding the slot and another signal will add too much unnecessary code that can be simplified and abstracted from by sending a processRequest that carries a command struct with the engine which can process the request then return an abstract data type. Doing it this way will keep the engine code modular and make it much easier to scale since the functionality would have to be added along with rhe command.

Potential issues that may rise are sharing a singular buffer for specific data or keeping memory usage low when decoding audio data. More research must be done to see how this can be optimized, but for now, I can focus on implementing the request-response design.

## Next Milestone Goals

* Redesign audio engine and controller architecture
* Redirect all low level audio processing for the AudioEngine class

## Backlog

* Draw the wave form of the current audio file for the AudioPlayer page.
* Add UI feature to the audio controller to add a song to queue.
* Add functionality to save the audio file path, so that upon exit, the audio files can be booted up with the program and the user can view the audio files without needing to load them on startup every time.

## Future Plans

* Create navigation buttons for the main pages/features of the audio production tool.
* Draw wave form of the selected audio file.
* Add functionality for project creation and load project.
* Create functionality for making a sound track using sub-tracks.
