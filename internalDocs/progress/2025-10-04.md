## Updates for General Project Management

The project will under go a complete reconstruction into using Qml. The multithreading features that Qt Widgets provides, although easy to use and powerful, would not be sufficient for this particular use case. The goal of this project is to combine my interests in audio/music, math, and low level programming to build a low latent real time audio production tool, and Qt widgets has too much overhead with processing power.

The meta object system with signals and slots provide too much overhead when communicating with other objetcs; especially objects in another thread, and no matter how you optimize it, the default behaviour can add detrimental delays to a real time system. This can be due to the GUI thread and all UI rendering being done by the CPU which can affect thread scheduling, CPU usage, and other details I didn't look too far into.

With the knowledge that I have right now, the new development design choice I will move forward with for this design is to use Qml as the frontend to send commands to my backend (same as before), but since Qml uses hardware acceleration, it can utilize the GPU and is more common among other developers to use for real time systems. This gives me a change to keep familiarity with the project as I do not have to learn every from scratch, but still giving me a chance to learn modern practices.

The next decision I'll have to make is choosing a bare bone low level audio library to focus on digital signal processing and gain an introduciton to how audio drivers work by viewing the documentation as I go.

The current development will go into another branch, so any code that can be ported/referenced over will remain in the code, but the main branch will have most of the source code removed.
