## Third-Party and Audio Engine Updates

Progress for implementing the AudioEngine class has begun and new issues from third party packages have been found and resolved. A critical update was made to the libsndfile library where the previous installation did not support decoding popular audio formats, such as .mp3, so a reinstallation of the library was needed. To support popular audio formats, vcpkg was installed to manage packages and dependencies more easily, and was used to build/link the necessary dependencies with libsndfile for proper audio file decoding.

As for the AudioEngine class, major updates and progress has been made. RtAudio and libsndfile have been incorporated into the class for decoding audio files and playing audio through the device. The way RtAudio plays audio is by opening an stream with audio parameters, such as setting the output device, number of channels, sample rate, etc, which then uses a callback funtion that fills in a buffer with individual samples; when multiple channels are used, the samples are interleaved within an array and need to be handled properly when populating the buffer. I current have functionality to open and decode an audio file, then play the audio file through the default audio device for the PC. Existing issues include audio cutting out somewhere in the middle of the file, so that might be an issue with calculating the indices output/input indicies for filling in the interleaved buffer, but the overall setup is done. I also created an virtual/abstract audio source class that gets passed into the streamAudioCallback function, so that later on in development, the function can be reused for multiple sources, such as a tone, synths, or mixed audio.

Progress is and functionality is verified using tests with the Google test library. Since so little has been done so far, I've only written unit tests for proper object initialization and loading/playing audio files.

## Next Milestone Goals

* Create APIs and additional classes for generating basic tones and be able to play them using the abstract audio source class.

## Backlog

* Create worker thread relationship between engine and controller, using C++ native threading solutions
* Create basic UI for a generic home page

## Future Plans

* NA
