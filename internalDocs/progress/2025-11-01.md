## Tone Generation and Audio Engine Updates

Significant progress has been made on the AudioEngine class, particularly in the area of tone generation. New classes and APIs have been created to facilitate the generation and playback of basic tones, such as sine waves, square waves, and sawtooth waves. These tone generators utilize mathematical functions to create audio samples in real-time, which are then fed into the existing audio playback system.

The issue with playing audio files has been resolved with the root cause being incorrect sample index being calculated and leading accessing memory outside the vector array.

New tests were created to verify the tone generation functionality and pass as intended.

## Next Milestone Goals

* Develop an ADSR envelope generator for static audio sources and samples

## Backlog

* Research/ Play around with ideas for creating sound more dynamically, rather than creating all sample tones in advance
* Create worker thread relationship between engine and controller, using C++ native threading solutions
* Create basic UI for a generic home page

## Future Plans

* NA
